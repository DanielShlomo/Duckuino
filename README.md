#Duckuino
Simple DuckyScript -> Arduino converter/compiler.

The original Rubber Ducky cannot perform Mouse control, But the Duckuino sure can.

##Live version here: https://d4n5h.github.io/Duckuino/

###Commands:
https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript

The commands are basically the same except that you can simulate a mouse with Duckuino like so:
"MOUSEMOVE xPos,yPos,wheelPos" for positioning and "MOUSECLICK left/right/middle" for clicks.
