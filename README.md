#Duckuino
##Live version here: https://d4n5h.github.io/Duckuino/
Simple DuckyScript -> Arduino converter/compiler.
The original Rubber Ducky cannot perform Mouse control, But the Duckuino sure can.

###NOTE: When emulating a mouse - you should use mouse in absolute mode (not relative mode).
### More info on absolute mode: https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=94140.0

###NOTE: You should update the Arduino IDE to the latest version for better cross-platform compatibility! (Or use the Arduino Create Web IDE)

###Commands: https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript
The commands are basically the same except that you can simulate a mouse with Duckuino like so:
"MOUSEMOVE xPos,yPos,wheelPos" for positioning and "MOUSECLICK left/right/middle" for clicks.
